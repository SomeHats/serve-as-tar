# serve-as-tar

Serve directories as tar packages.

#### Usage:
```sh
npm install -g serve-as-tar
serve-as-tar [--port <port number>] some-directory some-other-directory ...
```

#### Ignoring files
Create a `.serve-as-tar-ignore` file in each directory that you're serving. It should look just like
a `.gitignore` file.
